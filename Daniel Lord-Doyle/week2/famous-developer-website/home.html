                    <h3><strong>Fun fact #1</strong> - Mary also moved to Australia for a few years!</h3>
                    <h3><strong>Fun fact #2</strong> - While at Ferranti, Woods discovered that the women in her department were getting less pay than the men. She presented the case to the personnel department and was able to convince them to grant equal pay and rights for women.</h3>
