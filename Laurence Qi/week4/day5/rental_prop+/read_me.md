HOMEWORK: create your own CRUD app using ActiveRecord, with the same functionality as the pets & owners app but with a different theme (bands and their albums?), i.e. two database tables and a one-to-many association between the tables
You can use today's codealong in the repo above as your guide but I recommend not copy-pasting the code, rather type it out afresh - this will force you to run it through your fingers and brain, and make you think about what's happening
Bonus:
can the pets edit page allow the user to change the owner a pet belongs to? Ideally using a dropdown menu to select from the list of available owners in the system? (without hardcoding the owner names and IDs in the ERB template)? :thinking_face:


NOTE: What are the primary models: 
	✔    "Rental Properties" (No link to any other db member through sql, however one col will be generated by querying the other locations. )
    
	✔    "People" to many
	✔    "Locations to travel to" to one

TODO: make a sort function for the apartments. 
TODO: use the images in the single_rental pages

NOTE: Major functions
    People
    Properties
    Destinations

    CRUD for all of these.
    
NOTE: get the actual visual elements of this project up to scratch 25% of your time spent on this.
