<h2>Sage Project</h2>
<div class="projects_container">
<p>
    From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab, <br>where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), used by the U.S. <br>Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft. <br><br>She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories. <br>The SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and <br> track their movements using simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense. <br>It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.

<h2>Draper Laboratory</h2><br>

<p class="imgalign"><br>Hamilton then joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which worked on the Apollo Space Mission. <br>Hamilton was initially hired as a programmer for this process but moved on into system designs. Eventually, she was in charge of all Command Module software, <br>which was all the software for navigation and lunar landing guidance. She eventually led a team credited with developing the software for Apollo and Skylab.<br> Hamilton's team was responsible for developing in-flight software, which included algorithms designed by various senior scientists <br>for the Apollo command module, lunar lander and the subsequent Skylab.<br><br>Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software. This included error detection and recovery software <br>such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays), which Hamilton designed and developed.<br> She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist.<br> Hamilton also served as Director of the Software Engineering Division.

<h2>Apollo Program</h2>

<p>
    In one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the Apollo Guidance Computer, together with the on-board flight software, averted an abort of the landing on the Moon.<br> Three minutes before the lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. <br> The on-board flight software captured these alarms with the "never supposed to happen displays" interrupting the astronauts with priority alarm displays. <br> Hamilton had prepared for just this situation years before. Under some accounts, the astronauts had inadvertently left the rendezvous radar switch on, <br>causing these alarms to be triggered (whether the radar was left on inadvertently by the astronauts is disputed by Robert Wills with the National Museum of Computing).<br> The computer was overloaded with interrupts caused by incorrectly phased power supplied to the lander's rendezvous radar.<br> The program alarms indicated "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.<br> The asynchronous executive designed by J. Halcombe Laning was used by Hamilton's team to develop asynchronous flight software.<br> Hamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them that there was an emergency <br>"giving the astronauts a go/no go decision (to land or not to land)". Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer in mission control, <br>recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, "Go, go!" and they continued. <br>Paul Curto, senior technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton's work "the foundation for ultra-reliable software design"
