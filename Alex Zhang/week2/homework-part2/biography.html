        <h1>Early Life.</h1>
        <p>
            Alan was born in <span> England, in 1912</span>. He was a super smart kid – in fact, his teachers thought he was a <span>genius</span>! The trouble was, that his boarding school in Dorset mostly taught <span> classics </span> (ancient languages and literature) and Alan found these <span>really dull</span>.
            <br><br>
            Instead, Alan loved<span> maths</span>. He spent most of his time at school solving <span> complex chess problems</span> and learning advanced science all on his own.
            <br><br>
            When he was 16, Alan formed a very close friendship with a fellow pupil called Christopher. He inspired Alan to come out of his shell and <span>work harder </span>at school.
            <br><br>
            When Christopher tragically died a couple of years later, Alan was determined to honour his memory by devoting himself to study. So, in 1931, he headed to <span>King’s College, University of Cambridge, </span> study maths. Shortly after, in 1936, he moved to Princeton University in the USA to complete a PhD.
