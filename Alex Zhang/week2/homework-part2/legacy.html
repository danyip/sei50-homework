        At Princeton, Alan developed one of his most famous ideas – a universal computing machine (later called a Turing machine) that would be able to decode and perform any set of instructions.
        <br><br>
        During Alan’s lifetime, the machine remained just a theory and was never actually built – but his ideas laid the groundwork for modern computing, which has transformed the world we live in!
