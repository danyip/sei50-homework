            <h2>The creation of Ruby</h2>

            <p class="ruby-text">Ruby was concieved in 1993 after Yukihiro discussed the possibility of an object oriented programming language with a colleage.</p>
            
            <p class="ruby-text">
            At the time Yukihiro was not impressed with Perl4 and Python. He thought Perl felt like a <em>"toy language"</em> and the object-oriented features in Python appeared to be an add-on. Yukihiro was after a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language.</p>
            
            <p class="ruby-text">
            Since he could not find one after searching he set about making it himself. Yukihiro released the first version on the 21st of December 1995.
             </p>

            <p class="ruby-text">
                Matz design intent for Ruby was to create a programming language with the programmer in mind. He focused on making the language enjoyable and productive for the programmer. 
            </p>

            <h2>About Ruby</h2>

            <p class="ruby-text">
                Ruby is object-oriented: every value is an object, including classes and instances of types that many other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, booleans, and "null"). Variables always hold references to objects. Every function is a method and methods are always called on an object. Methods defined at the top level scope become methods of the Object class. Since this class is an ancestor of every other class, such methods can be called on any object. They are also visible in all scopes, effectively serving as "global" procedures. Ruby supports inheritance with dynamic dispatch, mixins and singleton methods (belonging to, and defined for, a single instance rather than being defined on the class). Though Ruby does not support multiple inheritance, classes can import modules as mixins.

Why I admire them

Something that I probably don't already know about them -->




<!-- Optional extras
Experiment with custom fonts, Font Awesome, Google Fonts etc.

Look into CSS3 animations
