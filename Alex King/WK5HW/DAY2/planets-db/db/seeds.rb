# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# In Sinatra, we had aplanets.sql which BOTH created the table structure
# (in Rails we have a migration instead) AND added some rows to the
# table for testing, using "INSERT INTO.." SQL statements
# This is a Ruby file which will use ActiveRecord methods instead!

# Let's use '.create! because it FAILS LOUDLY (i.e. raises an error)
# if the create doesn't actually insert a row - this helps us debug
