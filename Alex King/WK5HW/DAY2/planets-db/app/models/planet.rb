    # This model file tells ActiveRecord where to find your
    # database table - it used the pluralised lowercase
    # version of this class name, i.e. 'planets'

    # Later on, we will also specify out associations
    # here, such as 'has_many :astronauts' etc. 

    # Much late on, you can also define your own methods
    # here to specify business logic for this model 

    # "Fat models, skinny controllers"
