                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_name#Maiden_and_married_names" target="blank_">née</a>
                Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for
                her work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage" target="blank_">Charles
                    Babbage's</a> proposed mechanical general-purpose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"
                    target="blank_">computer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine"
                    target="blank_">the Analytical Engine</a>. She was the first to recognise that the machine had
                applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried
                out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer" target="blank_">programmer</a>.</p>


            <p> Ada Byron was the only child of poet Lord Byron and mathematician Lady Byron. All of Byron's other
                children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was
                born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is
                thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?". He died in Greece
                when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and
                logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada
                remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to
                him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She
                married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of
                Lovelace. Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew
                Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles
                Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as "poetical
                science" and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".</p>

            <p>When she was a teenager (18), her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and
                friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers".
                She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in
                June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rightSide">
            <p>Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the
                Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called "Notes". Lovelace's
                notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first
                computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject
                this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first
                programs for the engine. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond
                mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on
                those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical
                Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a
                collaborative tool.</p>

            <p>She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36, the same age at which her father died. </p>

        <h3>Biography</h3>


        <h4><a id="BioChild" href="homepage.html#BioChild">Childhood:</a></h4>
        <div class="leftSide">
            <p>Lord Byron expected his child to be a "glorious boy" and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a
                girl. The child was named after Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called "Ada" by Byron
                himself. On 16 January 1816, at Lord Byron's command, Lady Byron left for her parents' home at Kirkby
                Mallory, taking their five-week-old daughter with her. Although English law at the time granted full
                custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his
                parental rights, but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare. </p>
            <p>On 21 April, Lord Byron signed the deed of separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for
                good a few days later. Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to
                make allegations about her husband's immoral behaviour. This set of events made Lovelace infamous in
                Victorian society. Ada did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight
                years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life. Lovelace was not shown the
                family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday.</p>
            <p>Lovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her
                maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal
                attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting
                as mitigation—Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included
                writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to
                retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern. In one letter to Lady Milbanke,
                she referred to her daughter as "it": "I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very
                glad when you have it under your own." Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for
                any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the "Furies" and later complained they
                exaggerated and invented stories about her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rightSide">
            <p>Lovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that
                obscured her vision. In June 1829, she was paralyzed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to
                continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By
                1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and
                technological skills. </p>

        <h4><a id="BioAdult" href="homepage.html#BioAdult">Adult Years:</a></h4>
        <div class="leftSide">
            <p>Lovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville, who introduced her to Charles Babbage in
                1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville, and they corresponded for many years.
                Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone,
                Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen "and
                became a popular belle of the season" in part because of her "brilliant mind."By 1834 Ada was a
                regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many
                people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse, Byron's friend,
                described her as "a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features,
                particularly the mouth". This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada
                made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led
                her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became
                friends.</p>
            <p>On 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King. They had three homes: Ockham
                Park, Surrey; a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire; and a house in London. They spent their
                honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir, Somerset. The Manor had been built as a
                hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became their
                summer retreat and was further improved during this time. From 1845, the family's main house was Horsley
                Towers, built in the Tudorbethan fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles
                Barry, and later greatly enlarged to Lovelace's own designs.

                They had three children: Byron (born 1836); Anne Isabella (called Annabella, born 1837); and Ralph
                Gordon (born 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced "a tedious and
                suffering illness, which took months to cure."Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace
                and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham, meaning Ada became the
                Countess of Lovelace. In 1843–44, Ada's mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada's
                children and to act as a "moral" instructor for Ada. He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to
                express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an
                "unbecoming" manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it
                off. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rightSide">
            <p>In 1841, Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by
                Ada's mother that Ada's father was also Medora's father. On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her
                mother: "I am not in the least astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years
                felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in
                any way suspected."She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed
                Augusta Leigh: "I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was."In the 1840s, Ada flirted
                with scandals: firstly, from a relaxed approach to extra-marital relationships with men, leading to
                rumours of affairs; and secondly, from her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than £3,000 on
                the horses during the later 1840s. The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends,
                and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went
                disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it
                all to her husband. She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards.
                John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She
                bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her. During her final illness,
                she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.</p>

        <h4><a id="BioEducation">Education</a></h4>
        <div class="leftSide">
            <p>From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her interest in
                mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of
                the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an
                early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King, and
                Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the
                mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her "much help in her mathematical studies" including study of
                advanced calculus topics including the "numbers of Bernoulli" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for
                Babbage's Analytical Engine). In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in
                mathematics might lead her to become "an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate
                eminence."</p>
            <p>Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and
                scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring
                "the unseen worlds around us."</p>
