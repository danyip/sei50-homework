// Write a function called guessLetter that will:
// Take one argument, the guessed letter.
// Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
// If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
// When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__') and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
// It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed, and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.

// Create an array to hold your top five choices of something (colors, presidents, whatever). If you choose movies, the right top choice is "Satantango".
//
// For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
// Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number.
// Extra Challenges to Achieve Array Mastery
// Starting with an empty array called rainbowColors:

// choiceIs
// Add "orange" to the end of the array
// Add "red" to the start of the array
// Add "yellow" to the end
// Add "green", "blue", "indigo", and "violet" to the end of the array
// Try and do this using one method
// Log out the length of the array
// Log out the second item
// Log out the last item (make this flexible/dynamic!)
// Log out the index of the string "blue"
// Bonus: Find out the difference between .slice and .splice
